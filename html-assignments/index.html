        <h2>I am a international student of <em>Algonquin College</em>.</h2>
        <p>My journey for higher studies starts from India after completing my senior secondary education. I accomplish my 12<sup>th</sup> standard with commerce. As from the beginning I love to click photographs and make videos with my teammates andthese things build up my interst in picking up the Interactive Media Design Co-op program.
        </p>
        <p>Secondly, I have given my first priority to Canada for my greater studies because this country is known for its advanced level of courses with latest technologies and learning materials, that is why <abbr title="Algonquin College"></abbr>AC is the one in achieving my target. After completion of my program I wish to become an      professional web developer and a photographer. <blockquote>"You can do anything as long as you have the passion, the drive, the focus, and the support" <cite>  Sabrina Bryan</cite></blockquote>
